[[overview]]
== Overview

The Anypoint CDC Software Connector provides connectivity to the CDC Software API, enabling you to interface with CDC Software to retrieve telephony events and perform operations on more than a dozen telephony systems..
//Global rule: the word "connector" should be lower case except when appearing in titles, important URL anchors, and after a MuleSoft tradename such as "Anypoint".

Read through this user guide to understand how to set up and configure a basic flow using the connector.


[[important-concepts]]
== Important Concepts

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint Connectors, and
Anypoint Studio.


[[requirements]]
== Hardware and Software Requirements

To use the CDC Software Platform Connector you must have in-place an installation of the CDC Platform.  For additional system support information, visit the link:release-notes.html[CDC Software Platform Connector Release Notes].

[[install]]
== How to Install

You can install the connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in
link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/getting-started/anypoint-exchange#installing-a-connector-from-anypoint-exchange[Installing a Connector from Anypoint Exchange].


[[global-element]]
=== Configuring the Global Element
To use the CDC Software connector in your Mule application, you must configure a global CDC Software element that can be used by all the CDC Software connectors in the application (read more about  link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/global-elements[Global Elements].)

image::cdc_software_platform_global_elements_001.jpg[Global Elements]

- Click the Global Elements tab at the base of the canvas, then click Create.
- In the Choose Global Type window, expand Connector Configuration, and click CDC Software: Configuration.

image::cdc_software_platform_global_types_002.jpg[Global Types]

- Click Ok
- Enter the global element properties:

image::cdc_software_platform_server_003.jpg[Global Server]

image::cdc_software_platform_security_004.jpg[Global Security]


[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Name |Enter a name for the configuration to reference it.
|Domain |The URL of your DTK installation.
|Server Id |The instance name of your installation.
|User |The authorized user.
|Password | The authorized user password.
|===

You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties,
or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance
and better re-usability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file.
Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different
environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ.
See link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/deploying-to-multiple-environments[Deploying to Multiple Environments]
for instructions on how to manage this.

- Click OK to save the global connector configurations.

[[upgrading]]
=== Upgrading from an Older Version

If you’re currently using an older version of the connector, a small popup appears in the bottom right corner of Anypoint Studio with an "Updates Available" message.

. Click the popup and check for available updates. 
. Click the Connector version checkbox, click *Next*, and follow the instructions provided by the user interface. 
. *Restart* Studio when prompted. 
. After restarting, when creating a flow and using the connector, if you have several versions of the connector installed, you may be asked which version you would like to use. Choose the version you would like to use.

Additionally, we recommend that you keep Studio up to date with its latest version.


[[operations]]
== Operations

CDC Software connector as a stream connector currently supports the following list of operations:

- Get Events

CDC Software connector as an operation connector currently supports the following list of operations:

- Make Call
- Answer Call
- Release Call

[[adding-stream]]
== Adding Connector to Mule Flow as a Stream

1.	Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
2.	Drag the CDC Software connector onto the canvas, then select it to open the properties editor.
3.	Configure the connector by using previously define configuration and selecting the “Get events” operation.

[[adding-process]]
== Adding Connector to Mule Flow as a Process

1.	Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
2.	Drag the CDC Software connector onto the process section of the flow.
3.	Configure the connector by using previously define configuration and select the processor operation.

[[common-use-cases]]
== Common Use Cases

The primary purpose of the CDC Software Platform Connector is to expose the primary call events
of the supported telephony systems directly to Mulesoft to support the triggering of
actions within other Mulesoft connectors.  For example, the answering of a call could
be mapped to a action (create, modify, search etc.) in another Mulesoft connector.
Examples might be:

-	Screen-popping a CRM.
-	Updating or opening a webpage or web service
-	Sending an email
-	Writing or reading a record to/from a DB

See following use case examples:

- link:#use-case-1[Trigger email via phone call ...]

[use-case-1]
=== Trigger email

Create a Mule application that generates an email at the end of a call.

image::cdc_software_platform_email_007.jpg[Email Flow]

-	Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
-	Drag CDCSoftware connector on to the canvas, then select it to open the properties editor console.
-	Configure the CDCSoftware connector with domain, server id, user, and password.
-	Drag an Expression Filter, and double-click the connector to open its Properties Editor.

image::cdc_software_platform_email2_008.jpg[Email Flow2]

-	Edit the expression to filter by DTK event CALL END #[message.inboundProperties.event=='DTK_EXT_TELEPHONY_CALL_ENDED']
-	Drag a Java Transformer to create your custom logic to retrieve customer email by phone as example below:
